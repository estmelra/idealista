    "# **Idealista scraper**\n",
    "*Jose Ramon Estevez Melgarejo 2022-03-04.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to the first mini project of my personal portfolio where I create a web scraper to obtain valuable information from [Idealista](https://www.idealista.com). When structuring my portfolio I thought that a good Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was the first thing I needed to do in order to showcase my abilities. After searching for a messy dataset I could work with for some time I decided to create my own scraper to obtain data for my analysis. So this project will be divided into tree parts:\n",

    "2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "3.  Machine Learning Regression model to estimate house price\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why idealista?\n",
    "Well idealista is one of the main real state platforms that Spanish people use to sell and buy houses. After having worked as a data scientist for more than three years I have finished plenty of projects but it is difficult to use them for my portfolio without revealing sensitive information about the companies I have been working for. Therefore, I decided to develop a study about the real state situation at my home city (Cadiz) that I could maybe benefit from. Also, idealista website is a relatively easy site to scrap and data is not really well-structured (I wanted to start my EDA with messy data as data cleansing is also a big part of data science).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scraping method\n",
    "As far as I know there are three main scraping libraries / frameworks. Scrapy, Selenium and Requests + Beautiful soup. Even though Scrapy and selenium seem to be more robust alternatives I decided not to over complicate my self and use Requests + Beautiful sou given that idealista website is relatively simple to scrap.\n",
